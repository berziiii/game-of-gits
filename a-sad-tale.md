House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Once Ned arrived at Kings Landing, he met up with Joffrey Barathian bent him over his knee and gave him a well deserved spanking. Joffrey cried so hard, in from of the good people of Kings Landing, that they removed him from the thrown. Since Kings Landing was without a ruler, Ned stark stepped up and became the new ruler of Westeros. To celebrate his rise to the thrown, he invited Daenerys of House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals, Lady Regnant of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm,Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, Mother of Dragons over for a cup of tea and everyone lived happily ever after!
